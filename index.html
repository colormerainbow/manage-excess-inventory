        <section class="side-side">
        <div class="side-p">
            <p>Supply Chain Excess is the extra material in the short-term supply chain due to common practices in our manufacturing process, and includes inventory resulting from:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Mandated MOQ (minimum order quantity) purchases</li>
                <li>Risk buys of long lead-time parts</li>
                <li>Unintentional over-buying</li>
                <li>ECO-driven excess</li>
                <li>Inaccurate production forecasts</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Excess & Obsolence, however, is material that is formally declared excess and is not expected to have any demand). This material has usually been in the supply chain for months/years and has lost a lot of its value. Obsoleted parts are mostly outdated and have been replaced by newer revisions of material. </p>
